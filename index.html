         <p> About me: 

         <p>I’m interested lots of different kinds of design – graphic design, architecture, interior design. </p> 

         <p>During my free time I collect records and enjoy listening to old electronic albums or anything international that catches my eye. </p> 

         <p>I Have a small synthesizer that I like to play occasionally. </p> 

         <p>I also collect antiques, mostly silly trinkets, and gadgets. </p> 

         <p>I  watch a lot of films – especially ones from the 70’s for some reason. </p> 

         <p>I have a cat that is old enough to have a driver's license if she wanted to, but she likes to walk and be active. </p> 

         <p> Overall, I like to joke around with people and have a good time. </p>
